# Crowdbotics Python 3 Serverless Function Scaffold

This repository contains a scaffold which generates a basic serverless function in Python 3. It uses the [Serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework, and is written to be deployed to AWS Lambda.

Currently, this scaffold does not deploy, but that's coming soon! So, stay tuned for updates. It might be a while!
